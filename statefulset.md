# StatefulSet

**StatefulSets** are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following.

* Stable, unique network identifiers.
* Stable, persistent storage.
* Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
* Ordered, graceful deletion and termination.
* Ordered, automated rolling updates.

Use cases for **StatefulSets** are:

* Deploying a clustered resource (e.g. Cassandra, Elasticsearch)
* Applications that somehow depend on each other
