When I took the exam, I came across multiple tips and tricks to pass the exam.\
I’ll share some of them, as well as feedback from other candidates I spoke to.

You might be wondering why you should take the CKAD exam. I did too. Professionals are constantly looking for ways to upskill themselves and become more competitive in the job market. According to the Linux Foundation, by taking and passing the CKAD exam, you demonstrate your proficiency in Kubernetes and your ability to use it to deploy, manage, and scale applications. This is crucial for any DevOps or Software Engineer who wants to stay competitive in the job market. If you’re still skeptical, there are other reasons why taking the exam is beneficial.

The CKAD exam focuses on using Kubernetes (K8s) from an application developer’s point of view, compared with other exams such as the CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) which is more focused on the administration of Kubernetes clusters. The exam tests you on concepts such as launching and scaling pods, exposing applications via services, creating and storing configuration files and secrets, creating and using persistent volumes and so on.
