# DaemonSet

Some typical uses of a **DaemonSet** are:

* running a cluster storage daemon, such as `glusterd` and `ceph` on each node.
* running a logs collection daemon on every node, such as `fluentd` or `logstash`.
* running a node monitoring daemon on every node, such as `Prometheus Node Exporter`, `collectd`, `Datadog agent`, `New Relic agent`, or `Ganglia gmond`.
