## KubeConfig

```
kubect get pod --kubeconfig config
```

it is a file tha can store kubernetes configuration, usually located in `$HOME/.kube/config`

This file have the following format:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

`current-context` can be set as well

It links the clusters with users via contexts

```
kubectl config view
```

Also is possible to change other `configs` using the imperative mode



To append a new config file

```
export KUBECONFIG="${KUBECONFIG}:${HOME}/my-kube-config"
```
